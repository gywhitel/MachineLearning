# Rigid-Soft Coupled Gripper

![](fig/fig1.png)Fig 1. Load capacity comparison between soft gripper and rigid-soft coupled gripper.

![](fig/scatter.png)Fig 3. The scatter plot of the responses to eleven test  objects (the black dash lines indicate $\pm 3\sigma$ distance)

Each object was grasped for 20 times, and 20 sets of corresponding response are collected. We adopted a supervised learning algorithm KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) to verify the recognition potential of the sensory system. 

Training set: test set = 5 : 15
