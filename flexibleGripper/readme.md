Fig 5. A scatter plot of sensor responses to eleven test objects  (black dash lines indicate Â± 3 sigma distance)

Each object was grasped for 20 times, and 20 sets of corresponding response are collected. We adopted a supervised learning algorithm KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) to verify the recognition potential of the sensory system. 

Training set: test set = 5 : 15
