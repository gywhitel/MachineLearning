# [Rigid-Soft Coupled Gripper](flexibleGripper)

*The waterbomb origami mechanism is widely used in robotics. We proposed a rigid-flexible coupling gripper driven by vacuum. The stiffness of the gripper is increased due to steel facets attached to the gripper. The design combines the adaptivity of flexible grippers and high load capacity of rigid grippers. Three pressure sensors are arranged on the gripper as its sensory system, and their readings form a three-dimensional data space, which gives it distinct responses for different objects. Its distinctive response shows potential for object recognition. The ability is verified in this paper by adopting KNN algorithm to recognize gripping objects.*
