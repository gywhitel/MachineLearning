# Lab 1
## Assignment 0
> Motivate which problem is the most difficult for a decision tree algorithm to learn.

The MONK-2 problem will be the most difficult, because we have to rely on all of the attributes.

## Assignment 1
```
import dtree
import monkdata

entropy = [dtree.entropy(monkdata.monk1),
         dtree.entropy(monkdata.monk2),
        dtree.entropy(monkdata.monk3)]

for i in range(0,3):
    print(entropy[i])
```
Dataset | Entropy  
Monk1	| 1.0  
Monk2	| 0.957117428264771  
Monk3	| 0.9998061328047111  

## Assignment 2
Entropy for a uniform distribution (die) is larger than it is for non-uniform distribution (fake die).

## Assignment 4
>For splitting we choose the attribute that maximizes the information gain, Eq.3. Looking at Eq.3 how does the entropy of the subsets, Sk, look like when the information gain is maximized?

Sk subset will be the minimum entropy for the best gain

>How can we motivate using the information gain as a heuristic for picking an attribute for splitting?

We want to minimize the entropy of the full tree, if we choose the best information gain as our root, we will decrease the entropy as much as we can (sometimes, this will lead to a misplaced choice, for example a5 is arguably more important for MONK-3, but a2 is classified as best information gain.) - this attribute gives us the most information available about the test.

>Think about reduction in entropy after the split and what the entropy implies.

It's more predictable after we remove it, because that's what lower entropy means. (Fake die, lower entropy)

## Assignment 5
> Explain the results you get for the training and test datasets.

MONK-1 and MONK-3 have higher information gain, and thus they are easier to build correctly for a training set, when we try the actual data on these trees the results should be much better, which is also shown in the data above.

## Assignment 6
> Explain pruning from bias-variance trade-off perspective.

We want to catch bad branches because they can seriously affect our decision trees effectivity.

Bottom right branch, should be FFT, could be avoided by pruning.

# Lab 2

## 1.Move the clusters around to make it easier or harder for the classifier to find a decent boundary. Pay attention to when the qt function prints an error message that it can not find a solution

![](https://i.imgur.com/yJM1NJP.png)

Linear, unsolvable (Everything is on a straight line)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Vj8Bx3z.png)

Polynomial, unsolvable?, p = 2, test generated with great variance (V = 1)

![](https://i.imgur.com/NZICYHJ.png)

Radial, generated with overlapping (V=1)

```
classA = numpy.concatenate((numpy.random.randn(10,2) * V + [1.5,0.5] , numpy.random.rand(10,2) * V + [-1.5, 0.5]))
classB = numpy.random.randn(20,2) * V + [1.5, 0.5]
```


## 2.Implement some of the non-linear kernels. you should be able to classify very hard datasets

## 3.The non-linear kernels have parameters; explore how they influence the decision boundary. Reason about this in terms of the bias-variance trade-off

## 4.Explore the role of the parameter C. What happens for very large/small values?

## 5.Imagine that you are given data that is not easily separable. When should you opt for more slack rather than going for a more complex model and vice versa?

# Lab 3
```
import numpy


class data:
    'Features and labels'

    def __init__(self, feature, label):
        self.feature = feature
        self.label = label


# Read data from txt files
irisx = []
irisy = []
with open('D:\Python\MachineLearning\Lab3\irisX.txt') as f:
	for vector in f:
		irisx.append(vector.strip().split('\n'))

with open('D:\Python\MachineLearning\Lab3\irisY.txt') as f:
	for vector in f:
		irisy.append(vector.strip().split('\n'))

# len(irisX)*2
iris = []
for i in range(0,len(irisx)):
    iris.append(data(irisx[i],irisy[i]))
